# AdHocTemplate

AdHocTemplate is a template processor with simple but sufficent rules for some ad hoc tasks.

I conceived this template as a workaroud for some tasks in a working environment completely left behind the times (maybe 10-15 years or so?), where they don't seem to know what a database is.

And I hope this tool saves you from meaningless tasks when you have to face such a situation.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ad_hoc_template'
